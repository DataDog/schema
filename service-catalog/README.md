# Schema (v2)
Service Definition Schema is a JSON Schema that can be used to define metadata about a service in Datadog's Service Catalog. The latest schema version is v2. The schema is often used to: 
* Communicate a set of accepted metadata fields for a service
* Provide client side validations against user defined metadata files
* Add auto completion and validation in popular IDEs for user defined metadata files

# What is the Service Catalog?
Service Catalog is a new Datadog product that allows you to easily manage service ownership at scale and identify dependencies in complex, microservice-based applications. Built on top of the unified Datadog observability platform, Service Catalog helps you:

* Streamline root-cause investigations via a unified observability tool that leverages built-in integrations for Slack, PagerDuty, and Source Code 
* Automatically discover hundreds of APM services and RUM applications to quickly find owners, on-call engineers, and critical resources with minimal engineering effort
* Shorten new hire onboarding time with out-of-the-box answers to questions about system architecture, ownership, and different types of telemetry
